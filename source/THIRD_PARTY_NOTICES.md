## Terrain data

The `.wdt` terrain packages are derived from Terrain3D
elevation datasets published by the unofficial community project **WARDOGS
Artillery Calculator**, maintained by Apollyon. Source and rights information is
provided in `TERRAIN_DATA_NOTICE.md`. Community terrain data is not included in
the public source repository or portable release packages: redistribution rights
have not been confirmed. Users may import lawfully obtained compatible data
locally. Such data is not relicensed under the application's MIT license.
